# h5-play!

An experimental app which creates video playlists from a folder, keeps track of where you stopped watching and plays videos in the default browser.

For the fun of it, this app has been written with some of the coolest tech out there nowadays. That includes, NodeJS, ES6 (with babel compiler), Angular 2.0, HTML5 and Bootstrap 4.

#Install
npm i -g h5-play

#Usage
h5-play ~/videos

On Windows, that may look like this

h5-play C:\Users\Myself\Videos

#Accesibility and keyboard shortcuts
Once you run the application, your browser will open with a video playlist, which is accessible thru the keyboard.

##Controls for the current playing video
- Enter: Fullscreen mode
- Space bar: Play and stop
- Left arrow: Seek backwards
- Right arrow: Seek forward
- Up arrow: Speed up
- Down arrow: Slow down
